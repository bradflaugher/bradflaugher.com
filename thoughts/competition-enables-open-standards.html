          <div class="callout-title">Building on GNU Philosophy</div>
          <p><strong>I fully support GNU philosophy and the four freedoms.</strong> Where free software exists, we should use it without compromise. The GNU/Linux ecosystem demonstrates the power of this approach.</p>
          <p>But in domains like <strong>gaming and mobile</strong>, there are currently <strong>no truly free solutions</strong>. No mobile OS that works without proprietary firmware. No gaming console built entirely on free software. When forced to use proprietary tools, we face a strategic question GNU philosophy doesn't fully address: <em>which proprietary option should we choose?</em></p>
          <p>This article argues that the conventional answer—"choose the most open option"—while well-intentioned, can actually <em>entrench</em> proprietary control by killing the open standards we need for future free alternatives to emerge. <strong>We should choose strategically to advance software freedom, not just tactically for immediate openness.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>The "Most Open" Trap</h2>

        <p>The conventional wisdom in the free software community operates on a simple principle: <strong>always choose the most open option available.</strong> If everyone consolidates on more open platforms, we'll collectively move toward freedom.</p>

        <p>This sounds logical. It's also <strong>strategically naive.</strong></p>

        <p>I argue the opposite: <strong>Competition between proprietary platforms can promote open standards more effectively than consolidation around a "more open" platform.</strong> When proprietary platforms compete, they need open standards as neutral ground. When everyone consolidates on one platform—even a "more open" one—those standards die from lack of competitive pressure.</p>

        <p>Let me show you why this conventional wisdom fails, using specific examples of compromise choices that hurt more than they help.</p>

        <h2>Example #1: The GrapheneOS Compromise</h2>

        <h3>The "Most Open" Mobile Choice</h3>

        <p>Many in the privacy and free software community recommend GrapheneOS as the best mobile option. <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/" target="_blank">Privacy Guides</a>, for example, favors it in their <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/android/" target="_blank">mobile recommendations</a> for technically sound reasons:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>GrapheneOS has superior security hardening compared to stock Android</li>
          <li>Sandboxed Google Play is more secure than microG alternatives</li>
          <li>Timely security updates and active development</li>
          <li>Enhanced user profile isolation and privacy features</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From a <strong>tactical security perspective</strong>, Privacy Guides is absolutely correct. GrapheneOS provides better privacy and security than stock Android <em>today</em>.</p>

        <h3>Why This Strategy Fails Strategically</h3>

        <p>But here's what Privacy Guides' recommendation actually accomplishes in the long term:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>GrapheneOS requires Google Pixel hardware.</strong> The privacy community is literally buying Google's phones, funding Google's hardware division.</li>
          <li><strong>~90% of GrapheneOS users install Google Play Services anyway.</strong> Banking apps, work apps, and transportation apps don't work without it. The "degoogled" phone isn't actually degoogled.</li>
          <li><strong>It entrenches Android as "the" open mobile platform.</strong> When the entire privacy-conscious community uses Android (even hardened Android), developers have zero incentive to support anything else.</li>
          <li><strong>Progressive Web Apps become irrelevant.</strong> Why would developers invest in web standards when everyone in the "open" community is using Android native apps?</li>
          <li><strong>Google wins forever.</strong> Even in the privacy and free software world, Google's APIs become the permanent standard. Future alternatives must be Android-compatible or they're DOA.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Privacy Guides optimizes for individual user protection today, but sacrifices ecosystem health tomorrow.</strong> This is the fundamental flaw in tactical thinking without strategic vision.</p>

        <h3>The Strategic Alternative</h3>

        <p>Here's what I do instead: <strong>Use any phone (iPhone or Android), but reject native apps entirely in favor of Progressive Web Apps.</strong></p>

        <p>When iPhone and Android compete, neither can control the standard. Developers who want to reach both platforms need platform-agnostic solutions. The web fills that gap. By using PWAs exclusively, you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep web standards relevant and maintained.</strong> Competition drives web API improvements.</li>
          <li><strong>Remain platform-agnostic.</strong> You're not locked into any vendor's ecosystem.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable future alternatives.</strong> When a truly free phone emerges, it just needs a good browser.</li>
          <li><strong>Vote with your behavior.</strong> Every PWA choice promotes open standards over proprietary app ecosystems.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is <em>more</em> strategically aligned with software freedom than using GrapheneOS. You're challenging the root problem (closed app ecosystems) rather than accepting a slightly better version of it.</p>

        <h2>Example #2: Building on GNU Philosophy</h2>

        <h3>What GNU Philosophy Actually Says</h3>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GNU Project</a> and <a href="https://www.fsf.org/" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation</a> have been clear about their principles since 1983:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer.'"</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The four essential freedoms are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
          <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it</li>
          <li>The freedom to redistribute copies</li>
          <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>I agree completely with these principles.</strong> Where truly free software exists, we should use it without compromise. The GNU/Linux ecosystem is a triumph of this philosophy.</p>

        <h3>The Unaddressed Question: Strategic Choices When No Free Option Exists</h3>

        <p>But GNU philosophy doesn't fully address this question: <strong>When forced to use proprietary software (because no free alternative exists), which proprietary option should we choose?</strong></p>

        <p>In domains like mobile and gaming, there are currently <strong>no truly free solutions</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No mobile OS that works without proprietary firmware and drivers</li>
          <li>No gaming console built entirely on free software</li>
          <li>No practical way to participate in these computing domains with 100% freedom</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The common answer is: <strong>"Choose the most open option available."</strong> Use GrapheneOS instead of stock Android. Use Steam Deck instead of PlayStation. This seems logical.</p>

        <p>But I believe this strategy, while well-intentioned, <strong>actually works against the long-term goal of software freedom</strong> by entrenching proprietary APIs and killing the open standards we need for future free alternatives.</p>

        <h3>The Strategic Alternative: Promote Open Standards</h3>

        <p>Instead of consolidating on "the most open" proprietary option, we should <strong>strategically choose options that keep open standards alive and maintained.</strong> This means:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Maintaining competition between proprietary platforms</strong> to prevent any single vendor from controlling standards</li>
          <li><strong>Ruthlessly favoring open standards</strong> (web, Vulkan, OCI, MCP) when using those platforms</li>
          <li><strong>Focusing on cross-platform compatibility</strong> rather than platform-specific features</li>
          <li><strong>Building free software that works across platforms</strong> via open standards</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This approach is exemplified by the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Linux Foundation</a>, which works with industry to create open standards that enable competition. The result? <strong>80% of organizations report that open standards promote competition</strong> (Linux Foundation 2023 State of Open Standards survey).</p>

        <p><strong>This is not a rejection of GNU philosophy—it's an extension of it.</strong> When we can't use free software yet, we should make choices that advance the cause of software freedom, not hinder it.</p>

        <h2>Historical Evidence: When Competition Created Open Standards</h2>

        <h3>WWDC 2007: The Path Not Taken</h3>

        <div class="callout">
          <div class="callout-title">A Personal Note</div>
          <p>I was in the audience at WWDC 2007 when Steve Jobs announced how third-party apps would work on the iPhone. At the time, many developers were skeptical—they wanted native apps with full hardware access. But looking back nearly two decades later, <strong>I still think Jobs was right.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>On June 11, 2007, Steve Jobs stood on stage and announced that the iPhone would run third-party applications—but <strong>only as web apps.</strong> No native apps. No App Store. Just the open web.</p>

        <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1nwLilQy64" target="_blank">his presentation</a>, Jobs said:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "The full Safari engine is inside of iPhone. And so, you can write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone. And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Developer pressure eventually forced Apple to create the App Store in 2008. We chose native apps over web standards. And with that choice, we locked ourselves into two proprietary ecosystems that now control mobile computing.</p>

        <p><strong>What if we'd stayed with web apps?</strong> Developers would have built for open web standards, not proprietary APIs. Users could switch between platforms without losing their apps. New platforms could compete immediately—they'd just need a good browser.</p>

        <p>Jobs' original vision was more strategically aligned with software freedom than anything the FSF or Privacy Guides recommends today.</p>

        <h3>Browser Wars: Competition Saved the Web</h3>

        <p>After Internet Explorer's dominance nearly killed web standards in the early 2000s, competition between Safari, Firefox, and Chrome <strong>revived and improved</strong> web standards:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>No single browser could control the web</strong> after IE's dominance ended</li>
          <li><strong>Web standards improved rapidly</strong> because of competitive pressure</li>
          <li><strong>This enabled the modern web</strong> that works across all platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If everyone had consolidated on "the most open browser" (say, Firefox), we wouldn't have the competitive pressure that drove HTML5, WebGL, WebAssembly, and modern web APIs.</p>

        <h3>Containers: Docker, OCI, and Podman</h3>

        <p>When Docker became dominant in 2015, it risked creating proprietary lock-in. But then <strong>competition emerged, and Docker helped create an open standard</strong> to prevent fragmentation.</p>

        <p>Docker, CoreOS, and others founded the <strong>Open Container Initiative (OCI)</strong> under the Linux Foundation. This wasn't altruism—it was strategic recognition that competition required neutral ground.</p>

        <p><strong>What OCI enabled:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Podman emerged as a Docker alternative</strong> with better security (daemonless, rootless)</li>
          <li><strong>Kubernetes became runtime-agnostic</strong>—any OCI-compliant runtime works</li>
          <li><strong>Container images became portable</strong>—build with Docker, run with Podman</li>
          <li><strong>Innovation accelerated</strong>—new runtimes could compete while maintaining compatibility</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If everyone had consolidated on Docker as "the standard," we'd be locked in. Instead, <strong>competition between Docker and Podman maintains pressure to improve the OCI standard itself.</strong></p>

        <h2>The General Principle</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <div class="callout-title">Competition → Cross-Platform Needs → Open Standards</div>
          <p>When proprietary platforms compete, they cannot all use each other's proprietary APIs. This creates demand for open, cross-platform standards. These standards enable future alternatives and prevent any single vendor from achieving permanent control.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>When Consolidation Kills Standards</h3>

        <p>Consolidating on "the most open option" harms open standards when:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>It reduces competitive pressure.</strong> One dominant platform means no need for cross-platform standards.</li>
          <li><strong>It entrenches one vendor's APIs.</strong> Even if more "open," those APIs become the de facto standard.</li>
          <li><strong>It makes alternatives impossible.</strong> Future platforms must be compatible with the dominant platform's APIs.</li>
          <li><strong>It reduces diversity.</strong> Monocultures are fragile; diversity enables resilience and innovation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>When Competition Promotes Standards</h3>

        <p>Competition between proprietary platforms promotes open standards when:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>No single vendor can control the standard.</strong> Multiple platforms need neutral ground.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-platform development becomes valuable.</strong> Developers want to reach all platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Open standards fill the gap.</strong> They become the bridge between competing platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Future alternatives remain possible.</strong> New platforms can use the same open standards.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Key Insight: Tactical vs. Strategic (And GNU Philosophy)</h3>

        <p>The difference between my approach and the "most open" strategy is <strong>time horizon and adherence to GNU philosophy</strong>:</p>

        <p><strong>GNU philosophy is clear:</strong> Where free software exists, use it without compromise. Where it doesn't exist, work to create it. But what should we use <em>while</em> we're working to create it? The conventional wisdom says "the most open option." I argue we should choose "whatever keeps open standards alive," because those standards are what will enable future free alternatives.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>GrapheneOS</strong> is a tactical improvement (better privacy today) but a strategic failure (entrenches Android forever, kills web standards)</li>
          <li><strong>Using PWAs on iPhone</strong> is a tactical compromise (proprietary OS) but a strategic success (promotes open standards, enables future free phones)</li>
          <li><strong>Steam Deck</strong> is a tactical improvement (Linux gaming) but a strategic risk (could entrench DirectX via Proton, kill Vulkan)</li>
          <li><strong>Using PlayStation alongside Linux gaming</strong> is a tactical compromise (proprietary console) but a strategic success (maintains open graphics APIs)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When truly open solutions don't exist, <strong>strategic direction matters more than tactical purity.</strong> GNU philosophy demands we advance software freedom, not just use "more open" software. Your choices today determine what's possible tomorrow.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Extending GNU Philosophy to Strategic Choices</h2>

        <p>I deeply respect the GNU Project, the Free Software Foundation, and organizations like Privacy Guides. I've supported them financially because I share their values and believe in the four freedoms.</p>

        <p><strong>GNU philosophy is absolutely right about using free software where it exists.</strong> Desktop computing, servers, development tools—these domains have excellent free software options, and we should use them without compromise.</p>

        <p>But GNU philosophy doesn't fully address this question: <strong>When forced to use proprietary software (because no free alternative exists), which proprietary option should we choose?</strong></p>

        <p>The conventional answer—"choose the most open option"—seems logical. But in domains like mobile and gaming where <strong>no truly free solution exists</strong>, this strategy:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Entrenches proprietary APIs</strong> as permanent standards (Android, DirectX)</li>
          <li><strong>Kills open standards</strong> that could enable future free alternatives (web, Vulkan)</li>
          <li><strong>Makes future free platforms impossible</strong> because the ecosystem has ossified around one vendor's APIs</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>I believe we should choose strategically to advance software freedom, not just tactically for immediate openness.</strong> This means:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining competition between proprietary platforms to prevent any single vendor from controlling standards</li>
          <li>Ruthlessly promoting open standards (web, Vulkan, OCI) when using those platforms</li>
          <li>Focusing on cross-platform compatibility rather than platform-specific features</li>
          <li>Building free software that works across platforms via open standards</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This approach keeps open standards alive and maintained—which is what we need for truly free alternatives to emerge in the future. This is what the Linux Foundation does successfully. This is what created the OCI. This is what Steve Jobs proposed in 2007 with web apps.</p>

        <p><strong>This is not a rejection of GNU philosophy. It's an extension of it to domains where we don't yet have freedom, but must choose strategically to create the conditions for future freedom.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Your behavior today shapes what's possible tomorrow. Choose strategically to advance software freedom, not just tactically for immediate openness.</strong></p>
