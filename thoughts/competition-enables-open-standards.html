          <div class="callout-title">Disclosure</div>
          <p>I am an associate member of the Free Software Foundation and have previously donated to and supported <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/" target="_blank">Privacy Guides</a>, the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/" target="_blank">GrapheneOS project</a>, and many other FOSS projects. This critique comes from a place of respect and shared values, but fundamental disagreement about strategy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Core Disagreement</h2>

        <p>The free software community—exemplified by the FSF's philosophy and Privacy Guides' recommendations—operates on a simple principle: <strong>always choose the most open option available.</strong> If everyone consolidates on more open platforms, we'll collectively move toward freedom.</p>

        <p>This sounds logical. It's also <strong>strategically naive.</strong></p>

        <p>I argue the opposite: <strong>Competition between proprietary platforms can promote open standards more effectively than consolidation around a "more open" platform.</strong> When proprietary platforms compete, they need open standards as neutral ground. When everyone consolidates on one platform—even a "more open" one—those standards die from lack of competitive pressure.</p>

        <p>Let me show you why the conventional wisdom fails, using the community's own recommendations as examples.</p>

        <h2>Critique #1: Privacy Guides and the GrapheneOS Recommendation</h2>

        <h3>What Privacy Guides Recommends</h3>

        <p><a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/" target="_blank">Privacy Guides</a> is one of the most respected privacy advocacy organizations. Their <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/android/" target="_blank">mobile recommendations</a> strongly favor GrapheneOS as the most secure and private mobile operating system. Their reasoning is technically sound:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>GrapheneOS has superior security hardening compared to stock Android</li>
          <li>Sandboxed Google Play is more secure than microG alternatives</li>
          <li>Timely security updates and active development</li>
          <li>Enhanced user profile isolation and privacy features</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From a <strong>tactical security perspective</strong>, Privacy Guides is absolutely correct. GrapheneOS provides better privacy and security than stock Android <em>today</em>.</p>

        <h3>Why This Strategy Fails Strategically</h3>

        <p>But here's what Privacy Guides' recommendation actually accomplishes in the long term:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>GrapheneOS requires Google Pixel hardware.</strong> The privacy community is literally buying Google's phones, funding Google's hardware division.</li>
          <li><strong>~90% of GrapheneOS users install Google Play Services anyway.</strong> Banking apps, work apps, and transportation apps don't work without it. The "degoogled" phone isn't actually degoogled.</li>
          <li><strong>It entrenches Android as "the" open mobile platform.</strong> When the entire privacy-conscious community uses Android (even hardened Android), developers have zero incentive to support anything else.</li>
          <li><strong>Progressive Web Apps become irrelevant.</strong> Why would developers invest in web standards when everyone in the "open" community is using Android native apps?</li>
          <li><strong>Google wins forever.</strong> Even in the privacy and free software world, Google's APIs become the permanent standard. Future alternatives must be Android-compatible or they're DOA.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Privacy Guides optimizes for individual user protection today, but sacrifices ecosystem health tomorrow.</strong> This is the fundamental flaw in tactical thinking without strategic vision.</p>

        <h3>The Strategic Alternative</h3>

        <p>Here's what I do instead: <strong>Use any phone (iPhone or Android), but reject native apps entirely in favor of Progressive Web Apps.</strong></p>

        <p>When iPhone and Android compete, neither can control the standard. Developers who want to reach both platforms need platform-agnostic solutions. The web fills that gap. By using PWAs exclusively, you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep web standards relevant and maintained.</strong> Competition drives web API improvements.</li>
          <li><strong>Remain platform-agnostic.</strong> You're not locked into any vendor's ecosystem.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable future alternatives.</strong> When a truly free phone emerges, it just needs a good browser.</li>
          <li><strong>Vote with your behavior.</strong> Every PWA choice promotes open standards over proprietary app ecosystems.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is <em>more</em> strategically aligned with software freedom than using GrapheneOS. You're challenging the root problem (closed app ecosystems) rather than accepting a slightly better version of it.</p>

        <h2>Critique #2: FSF's Absolutism and Practical Failure</h2>

        <h3>What the FSF Advocates</h3>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.fsf.org/" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation</a> has a principled, absolutist position: <strong>proprietary software is unethical and should be rejected entirely.</strong> Richard Stallman has argued that proprietary software is "a form of combat among the citizens of our society" and represents an "unacceptable danger to a free society."</p>

        <p>From an <strong>ethical purity perspective</strong>, the FSF is consistent and principled. Their commitment to the four freedoms is admirable.</p>

        <h3>Why This Strategy Fails Practically</h3>

        <p>But after <strong>40+ years</strong>, what has the FSF's absolutist approach actually accomplished?</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Created excellent free software infrastructure.</strong> GNU/Linux, GCC, Emacs, and countless other projects.</li>
          <li><strong>Influenced licensing and legal frameworks.</strong> The GPL has been hugely important.</li>
          <li><strong>But utterly failed to prevent proprietary platform dominance.</strong> Mobile computing is controlled by Apple and Google. Desktop computing is dominated by Windows and macOS. Cloud computing is controlled by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The FSF's strategy essentially <strong>concedes the mainstream market</strong> to proprietary vendors, then hopes people will eventually "see the light" and switch to free software. This hasn't worked and won't work.</p>

        <p>Most people will <em>never</em> use 100% free software. The FSF's absolutism makes them irrelevant to 99% of technology users. Meanwhile, proprietary platforms have become more entrenched than ever.</p>

        <h3>The Strategic Alternative: Pragmatic Engagement</h3>

        <p>Instead of boycotting proprietary platforms entirely, we should <strong>engage with them strategically to promote open standards.</strong> This means:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Using proprietary platforms when necessary</strong>, but demanding they support open standards</li>
          <li><strong>Maintaining competition between platforms</strong> to prevent any single vendor from controlling standards</li>
          <li><strong>Focusing on open standards</strong> (web, Vulkan, OCI, MCP) rather than "more open" platforms</li>
          <li><strong>Building free software that works across platforms</strong> via open standards</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is what the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Linux Foundation</a> does successfully. They work with industry to create open standards that enable competition. The result? <strong>80% of organizations report that open standards promote competition</strong> (Linux Foundation 2023 State of Open Standards survey).</p>

        <h2>Historical Evidence: When Competition Created Open Standards</h2>

        <h3>WWDC 2007: The Path Not Taken</h3>

        <div class="callout">
          <div class="callout-title">A Personal Note</div>
          <p>I was in the audience at WWDC 2007 when Steve Jobs announced how third-party apps would work on the iPhone. At the time, many developers were skeptical—they wanted native apps with full hardware access. But looking back nearly two decades later, <strong>I still think Jobs was right.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>On June 11, 2007, Steve Jobs stood on stage and announced that the iPhone would run third-party applications—but <strong>only as web apps.</strong> No native apps. No App Store. Just the open web.</p>

        <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1nwLilQy64" target="_blank">his presentation</a>, Jobs said:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "The full Safari engine is inside of iPhone. And so, you can write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone. And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Developer pressure eventually forced Apple to create the App Store in 2008. We chose native apps over web standards. And with that choice, we locked ourselves into two proprietary ecosystems that now control mobile computing.</p>

        <p><strong>What if we'd stayed with web apps?</strong> Developers would have built for open web standards, not proprietary APIs. Users could switch between platforms without losing their apps. New platforms could compete immediately—they'd just need a good browser.</p>

        <p>Jobs' original vision was more strategically aligned with software freedom than anything the FSF or Privacy Guides recommends today.</p>

        <h3>Browser Wars: Competition Saved the Web</h3>

        <p>After Internet Explorer's dominance nearly killed web standards in the early 2000s, competition between Safari, Firefox, and Chrome <strong>revived and improved</strong> web standards:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>No single browser could control the web</strong> after IE's dominance ended</li>
          <li><strong>Web standards improved rapidly</strong> because of competitive pressure</li>
          <li><strong>This enabled the modern web</strong> that works across all platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If everyone had consolidated on "the most open browser" (say, Firefox), we wouldn't have the competitive pressure that drove HTML5, WebGL, WebAssembly, and modern web APIs.</p>

        <h3>Containers: Docker, OCI, and Podman</h3>

        <p>When Docker became dominant in 2015, it risked creating proprietary lock-in. But then <strong>competition emerged, and Docker helped create an open standard</strong> to prevent fragmentation.</p>

        <p>Docker, CoreOS, and others founded the <strong>Open Container Initiative (OCI)</strong> under the Linux Foundation. This wasn't altruism—it was strategic recognition that competition required neutral ground.</p>

        <p><strong>What OCI enabled:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Podman emerged as a Docker alternative</strong> with better security (daemonless, rootless)</li>
          <li><strong>Kubernetes became runtime-agnostic</strong>—any OCI-compliant runtime works</li>
          <li><strong>Container images became portable</strong>—build with Docker, run with Podman</li>
          <li><strong>Innovation accelerated</strong>—new runtimes could compete while maintaining compatibility</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If everyone had consolidated on Docker as "the standard," we'd be locked in. Instead, <strong>competition between Docker and Podman maintains pressure to improve the OCI standard itself.</strong></p>

        <h2>The General Principle</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <div class="callout-title">Competition → Cross-Platform Needs → Open Standards</div>
          <p>When proprietary platforms compete, they cannot all use each other's proprietary APIs. This creates demand for open, cross-platform standards. These standards enable future alternatives and prevent any single vendor from achieving permanent control.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>When Consolidation Kills Standards</h3>

        <p>Consolidating on "the most open option" harms open standards when:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>It reduces competitive pressure.</strong> One dominant platform means no need for cross-platform standards.</li>
          <li><strong>It entrenches one vendor's APIs.</strong> Even if more "open," those APIs become the de facto standard.</li>
          <li><strong>It makes alternatives impossible.</strong> Future platforms must be compatible with the dominant platform's APIs.</li>
          <li><strong>It reduces diversity.</strong> Monocultures are fragile; diversity enables resilience and innovation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>When Competition Promotes Standards</h3>

        <p>Competition between proprietary platforms promotes open standards when:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>No single vendor can control the standard.</strong> Multiple platforms need neutral ground.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-platform development becomes valuable.</strong> Developers want to reach all platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Open standards fill the gap.</strong> They become the bridge between competing platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Future alternatives remain possible.</strong> New platforms can use the same open standards.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Key Insight: Tactical vs. Strategic</h3>

        <p>The difference between my approach and the FSF/Privacy Guides approach is <strong>time horizon</strong>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>GrapheneOS</strong> is a tactical improvement (better privacy today) but a strategic failure (entrenches Android forever)</li>
          <li><strong>Using PWAs on iPhone</strong> is a tactical compromise (proprietary OS) but a strategic success (promotes open standards)</li>
          <li><strong>Steam Deck</strong> is a tactical improvement (Linux gaming) but a strategic risk (could entrench DirectX via Proton)</li>
          <li><strong>Using PlayStation alongside Linux gaming</strong> is a tactical compromise (proprietary console) but a strategic success (maintains open graphics APIs)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When truly open solutions don't exist, <strong>strategic direction matters more than tactical purity.</strong> Your choices today determine what's possible tomorrow.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: The Free Software Movement Needs Strategic Thinking</h2>

        <p>I respect the FSF's principled stance and Privacy Guides' evidence-based approach. I've supported both financially because I share their values. But I believe their strategies are fundamentally flawed.</p>

        <p><strong>The FSF's absolutism</strong> has failed to prevent proprietary platform dominance after 40 years. Boycotting proprietary software doesn't work when 99% of users will never join you.</p>

        <p><strong>Privacy Guides' tactical focus</strong> optimizes for individual user protection today while sacrificing ecosystem health tomorrow. Recommending GrapheneOS entrenches the very Android ecosystem we should be trying to escape.</p>

        <p><strong>The strategic alternative</strong> is to engage with proprietary platforms pragmatically while ruthlessly promoting open standards. Maintain competition to prevent consolidation. Focus on cross-platform standards rather than "more open" platforms. Think long-term about network effects and ecosystem dynamics.</p>

        <p>This is what the Linux Foundation does successfully. This is what created the OCI. This is what Steve Jobs proposed in 2007 with web apps.</p>

        <p><strong>Your behavior today shapes what's possible tomorrow. Choose strategically, not tactically.</strong></p>
