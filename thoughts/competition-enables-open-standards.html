          I optimize for application portability over platform openness. My reasoning: applications are why people get locked into platforms.

          <div class="callout-title">Disclosure</div>
          <p>I am an associate member of the Free Software Foundation and have previously donated to and supported <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/" target="_blank">Privacy Guides</a>, the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/" target="_blank">GrapheneOS project</a>, and many other FOSS projects. This article comes from a place of respect and shared values, but represents a different optimization strategy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Core Argument: Switching Costs Matter More Than Platform Openness</h2>

        <p><strong>Platform lock-in happens at the application layer, not the OS layer.</strong> This is my central claim, and it leads to a different approach than the conventional "choose the most open platform" wisdom.</p>

        <p>Consider two scenarios:</p>

        <p><strong>Scenario A:</strong> You use GrapheneOS (more open platform) with Android native apps for banking, work, and social media.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Platform: More open (Android-based, hardened)</li>
          <li>Apps: Platform-specific (Android native)</li>
          <li>Switching cost: <strong>High</strong> — lose all your apps if you switch to a different OS</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Scenario B:</strong> You use iPhone or stock Android (less open platform) with Progressive Web Apps only.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Platform: Less open (proprietary OS)</li>
          <li>Apps: Platform-agnostic (web standards)</li>
          <li>Switching cost: <strong>Low</strong> — keep all your apps if you switch to any platform with a browser</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>I choose Scenario B because I think it gives me more long-term freedom.</strong> The platform being "more open" doesn't help if I can't leave it without losing my applications.</p>

        <p>This is not a claim that I'm more strategic than everyone else. It's a claim that <strong>I'm optimizing for a different thing</strong>—application portability instead of platform openness—because I think portability matters more for reducing lock-in.</p>

        <h2>What I'm Giving Up</h2>

        <p>This approach has real costs, and I want to be honest about them:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Worse app experience today:</strong> PWAs are often inferior to native apps—slower performance, fewer features, worse offline support, and limited hardware access.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform security:</strong> GrapheneOS has better security hardening than stock iOS or Android. I'm trading platform-level security for application-level portability.</li>
          <li><strong>Individual impact is tiny:</strong> My PWA usage doesn't move the needle on web standards unless many others do the same. I'm making a bet, not guaranteeing an outcome.</li>
          <li><strong>Practicality challenges:</strong> Some essential services don't offer good PWAs. I sometimes have to use workarounds, mobile websites, or make compromises.</li>
          <li><strong>Missing out on platform-specific features:</strong> Native apps can do things PWAs can't (yet)—better camera integration, background processing, system-level features.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>I'm making a bet that application portability matters more than platform openness for my threat model and values.</strong> You might reasonably disagree, especially if you prioritize maximum security today over switching flexibility tomorrow.</p>

        <h2>Why I Think Competition Between Platforms Helps Open Standards</h2>

        <p>Here's the mechanism I think makes this approach defensible: <strong>When proprietary platforms compete, they need open standards as neutral ground.</strong></p>

        <p>When iPhone and Android compete, neither can force developers to use only their proprietary APIs. Developers who want to reach both platforms need platform-agnostic solutions. Open standards (web, Vulkan, open graphics APIs) fill that gap.</p>

        <p>When everyone consolidates on one platform—even a "more open" one like GrapheneOS—that competitive pressure disappears. Developers optimize for the dominant platform's native APIs because that's where the users are.</p>

        <p><strong>This is a claim about incentive structures, not a claim about moral superiority.</strong> I think maintaining competition between platforms creates better conditions for open standards than consolidating on the most open platform.</p>

        <h2>Two Valid Approaches to Platform Choice</h2>

        <p><strong>Privacy Guides and I are optimizing for different things:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Privacy Guides optimizes for:</strong> Maximum privacy and security on the platform you're actually using today. Their GrapheneOS recommendation makes perfect sense from this perspective—it's the most secure, privacy-respecting mobile OS available.</p>

        <p><strong>I optimize for:</strong> Minimum lock-in to any specific platform via portable applications. My PWA-focused approach makes sense from this perspective—it keeps switching costs low.</p>

        <p><strong>Privacy Guides is right if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You need maximum security and privacy right now</li>
          <li>You trust that platform competition will maintain itself without your individual choices</li>
          <li>You're willing to accept higher switching costs for better current security</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>I might be right if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You think application lock-in is the bigger long-term risk</li>
          <li>You're willing to sacrifice some security and features for portability</li>
          <li>You believe individual choices can collectively influence ecosystem dynamics</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>These aren't contradictory—they're different threat models and time horizons.</strong> I'm not claiming Privacy Guides is wrong. I'm claiming they're optimizing for something different than I am.</p>

        <h2>Owning My Behavior</h2>

        <p><strong>Full disclosure: I use an iPhone and a PlayStation.</strong> This seems hypocritical for someone questioning GrapheneOS recommendations. Let me explain my reasoning:</p>

        <p>I'm not claiming iOS is "more open" than GrapheneOS—it obviously isn't. <strong>I'm claiming that using open application standards (PWAs, Vulkan) on closed platforms reduces my switching costs more than using closed application standards (Android native apps) on a more open platform.</strong></p>

        <p>For gaming: I play games that use Vulkan or OpenGL. If a more open gaming platform emerges (Steam Deck, future Linux consoles), those games can be ported because they're built on open graphics APIs. I'm optimizing for game portability, not platform openness.</p>

        <p><strong>Am I rationalizing my consumer preferences?</strong> Maybe. But here's the specific mechanism I think makes this defensible:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Applications are what people actually care about and what creates lock-in</li>
          <li>If applications are portable (built on open standards), platform switching costs are low</li>
          <li>If applications are platform-specific (native apps), you're locked in regardless of how "open" the platform is</li>
          <li>Supporting applications built on open standards (even on closed platforms) keeps those standards relevant and maintained</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Is this perfect?</strong> No. Am I funding Apple's and Sony's closed ecosystems? Yes. But I think supporting applications built on open standards does more for long-term freedom than consolidating on the most open platform while using platform-specific applications.</p>

        <h2>Historical Evidence: When Competition Created Open Standards</h2>

        <h3>WWDC 2007: The Path Not Taken</h3>

        <div class="callout">
          <div class="callout-title">A Personal Note</div>
          <p>I was in the audience at WWDC 2007 when Steve Jobs announced how third-party apps would work on the iPhone. At the time, many developers were skeptical—they wanted native apps with full hardware access. But looking back nearly two decades later, <strong>I still think Jobs' original vision was more aligned with software freedom.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>On June 11, 2007, Steve Jobs stood on stage and announced that the iPhone would run third-party applications—but <strong>only as web apps.</strong> No native apps. No App Store. Just the open web.</p>

        <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1nwLilQy64" target="_blank">his presentation</a>, Jobs said:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "The full Safari engine is inside of iPhone. And so, you can write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone. And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Developer pressure eventually forced Apple to create the App Store in 2008. We chose native apps over web standards. And with that choice, we accepted higher switching costs between mobile platforms.</p>

        <p><strong>What if we'd stayed with web apps?</strong> Developers would have built for open web standards, not proprietary APIs. Users could switch between platforms without losing their apps. New platforms could compete immediately—they'd just need a good browser.</p>

        <h3>Browser Wars: Competition Saved the Web</h3>

        <p>After Internet Explorer's dominance nearly killed web standards in the early 2000s, competition between Safari, Firefox, and Chrome <strong>revived and improved</strong> web standards:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>No single browser could control the web</strong> after IE's dominance ended</li>
          <li><strong>Web standards improved rapidly</strong> because of competitive pressure</li>
          <li><strong>This enabled the modern web</strong> that works across all platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The competitive pressure between browsers drove HTML5, WebGL, WebAssembly, and modern web APIs. This is an example of competition creating conditions for open standards to thrive.</p>

        <h3>Containers: Docker, OCI, and Podman</h3>

        <p>When Docker became dominant in 2015, it risked creating proprietary lock-in. But then <strong>competition emerged, and Docker helped create an open standard</strong> to prevent fragmentation.</p>

        <p>Docker, CoreOS, and others founded the <strong>Open Container Initiative (OCI)</strong> under the Linux Foundation. This wasn't pure altruism—it was strategic recognition that competition required neutral ground.</p>

        <p><strong>What OCI enabled:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Podman emerged as a Docker alternative</strong> with better security (daemonless, rootless)</li>
          <li><strong>Kubernetes became runtime-agnostic</strong>—any OCI-compliant runtime works</li>
          <li><strong>Container images became portable</strong>—build with Docker, run with Podman</li>
          <li><strong>Innovation accelerated</strong>—new runtimes could compete while maintaining compatibility</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Competition between Docker and Podman maintains pressure to improve the OCI standard itself. This is another example of how competition can promote open standards.</p>

        <h3>AI Agents: MCP Emerges from Competition</h3>

        <p>The AI agent space demonstrates this dynamic happening in real time. Anthropic introduced the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> in late 2024, an open standard for connecting AI applications to external systems.</p>

        <p><strong>MCP exists because of competition between AI providers.</strong> If everyone had consolidated on a single AI platform, that platform would use proprietary APIs for tool integration. But because Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and others compete, developers need a platform-agnostic way to build tools and integrations.</p>

        <p><strong>What MCP enables:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Open source agents are viable</strong>—projects don't need to build proprietary integrations for every tool</li>
          <li><strong>Tool developers write once, support everywhere</strong>—an MCP server works with any MCP-compatible agent</li>
          <li><strong>No single AI vendor controls the ecosystem</strong>—you can switch between Claude, GPT, or local models without losing your tools</li>
          <li><strong>Future AI platforms can compete immediately</strong>—new entrants just need to support MCP</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is the pattern I'm pointing to: <strong>Competition between proprietary platforms creates demand for open standards, which then enable future alternatives.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Pattern: Competition → Cross-Platform Needs → Open Standards</h2>

        <p>When proprietary platforms compete, they cannot all use each other's proprietary APIs. This creates demand for open, cross-platform standards. These standards enable future alternatives and prevent any single vendor from achieving permanent control.</p>

        <p><strong>When consolidation may harm open standards:</strong></p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>It can reduce competitive pressure.</strong> One dominant platform may reduce the need for cross-platform standards.</li>
          <li><strong>It can entrench one vendor's APIs.</strong> Even if more "open," those APIs may become the de facto standard.</li>
          <li><strong>It may make alternatives harder.</strong> Future platforms may need to be compatible with the dominant platform's APIs.</li>
          <li><strong>It reduces diversity.</strong> Monocultures can be fragile; diversity can enable resilience and innovation.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>When competition may promote open standards:</strong></p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>No single vendor can control the standard.</strong> Multiple platforms need neutral ground.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-platform development becomes valuable.</strong> Developers want to reach all platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Open standards fill the gap.</strong> They become the bridge between competing platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Future alternatives remain possible.</strong> New platforms can use the same open standards.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Note the probabilistic language:</strong> I'm not claiming competition always helps or consolidation always hurts. I'm claiming that in domains where no truly free solution exists, maintaining competition while promoting open application standards may create better conditions for future freedom than consolidating on the most open platform.</p>

        <h2>Building on GNU Philosophy</h2>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GNU Project</a> and <a href="https://www.fsf.org/" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation</a> have been clear about their principles since 1983:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer.'"</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>I fully support GNU philosophy and the four freedoms.</strong> Where free software exists, we should use it without compromise. The GNU/Linux ecosystem demonstrates the power of this approach.</p>

        <p>But in domains like <strong>gaming and mobile</strong>, there are currently <strong>no truly free solutions</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No mobile OS that works without proprietary firmware and drivers</li>
          <li>No gaming console built entirely on free software</li>
          <li>No practical way to participate in these computing domains with 100% freedom</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>GNU philosophy doesn't fully address this question: When forced to use proprietary software (because no free alternative exists), which proprietary option should we choose?</strong></p>

        <p>The common answer is: "Choose the most open option available." This is a reasonable heuristic.</p>

        <p><strong>I propose a different heuristic: "Choose options that keep open application standards alive and maintained."</strong> This means:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining competition between proprietary platforms to prevent any single vendor from controlling standards</li>
          <li>Ruthlessly favoring open standards (web, Vulkan, OCI, MCP) when using those platforms</li>
          <li>Focusing on cross-platform compatibility rather than platform-specific features</li>
          <li>Building free software that works across platforms via open standards</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This approach is exemplified by the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Linux Foundation</a>, which works with industry to create open standards that enable competition.</p>

        <p><strong>This is not a rejection of GNU philosophy—it's a different interpretation of how to advance software freedom in domains where we don't yet have it.</strong></p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Different Optimizations for Different Goals</h2>

        <p>I deeply respect the GNU Project, the Free Software Foundation, and organizations like Privacy Guides. I've supported them financially because I share their values.</p>

        <p><strong>Where truly free software exists (desktop, servers, development tools), we should use it without compromise.</strong> I agree completely with the conventional approach here.</p>

        <p>But in domains where no truly free solution exists (mobile, gaming), I optimize differently:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>I prioritize application portability over platform openness</strong> because I think applications are what create lock-in</li>
          <li><strong>I use open application standards (web, Vulkan) on any platform</strong> rather than platform-specific applications on the most open platform</li>
          <li><strong>I accept trade-offs</strong>—worse app experience, less platform security, practicality challenges—because I think portability matters more for long-term freedom</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>This is not a claim that I'm more strategic than everyone else.</strong> It's a claim that I'm optimizing for a different thing—switching costs and application portability—because I think that matters more for long-term freedom than platform openness alone.</p>

        <p><strong>You might reasonably disagree.</strong> If you need maximum security today, GrapheneOS is an excellent choice. If you think platform openness matters more than application portability, consolidating on the most open platform makes sense.</p>

        <p><strong>My bet is that application portability matters more.</strong> Your behavior today shapes what's possible tomorrow. I'm choosing to support open application standards on any platform rather than platform-specific applications on the most open platform.</p>
