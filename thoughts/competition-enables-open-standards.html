        <h2>The Conventional Wisdom (and Why It's Wrong)</h2>
        
        <p>The conventional wisdom in the free software community goes something like this: <em>"Always choose the most open platform available. If everyone uses the most open option, we'll collectively move toward freedom."</em></p>

        <p>This sounds logical. It's also strategically naive.</p>

        <p>The reality is more nuanced and counterintuitive: <strong>competition between proprietary platforms can promote open standards more effectively than consolidation around a "more open" platform.</strong> Understanding this dynamic is crucial for making strategic technology choices that actually advance software freedom in the long term.</p>

        <h2>The Gaming Industry: A Perfect Case Study</h2>

        <h3>The Naive View</h3>

        <p>Steam Deck runs on Linux. Therefore, everyone should use Steam Deck to support Linux gaming. More Steam Deck users means more Linux gaming support. Simple, right?</p>

        <h3>The Sophisticated View</h3>

        <p>Competition between PlayStation, Xbox, and PC gaming forces developers to use cross-platform technologies. When these platforms compete, no single vendor can control the graphics API standard. Microsoft can't force everyone to use DirectX because Sony and Nintendo need alternatives. This keeps open graphics APIs like Vulkan and OpenGL maintained, relevant, and improving.</p>

        <p>Here's what actually happens when you have three competing gaming platforms:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cross-platform development becomes essential.</strong> Game studios want their titles on all platforms to maximize revenue. They use cross-platform engines like Unity and Unreal Engine.</li>
          <li><strong>Open APIs stay relevant.</strong> These engines rely on Vulkan and OpenGL because they need to target multiple platforms with different proprietary APIs.</li>
          <li><strong>Linux gaming benefits indirectly.</strong> The work done to support PlayStation's graphics stack (which uses Vulkan-like APIs) directly benefits Linux gaming.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Consolidation Trap</h3>

        <p>Now imagine everyone consolidated on Steam Deck and Windows PC. What would happen?</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>DirectX becomes the de facto standard.</strong> Why support OpenGL or Vulkan if everyone's on Windows or Proton (which translates DirectX anyway)?</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-platform engines become less important.</strong> Developers target DirectX directly for better performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Open APIs stagnate.</strong> Without competitive pressure, Vulkan and OpenGL development slows.</li>
          <li><strong>Future alternatives become impossible.</strong> New platforms must support DirectX to be viable, giving Microsoft permanent control.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Paradoxically, <strong>using PlayStation (a proprietary platform) maintains the competitive pressure that keeps open graphics APIs alive</strong>, which ultimately benefits Linux gaming more than consolidating on Steam Deck would.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <div class="callout-title">The FreeBSD Connection</div>
          <p>PlayStation 5's operating system is based on FreeBSD. Sony's investment in PlayStation drives FreeBSD development, with improvements flowing back to the open source BSD ecosystem. If PlayStation didn't exist and everyone used Linux-based systems, this diversity and development investment would disappear. Competition between proprietary platforms built on different open source foundations strengthens the entire ecosystem.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Mobile: The Same Pattern</h2>

        <h3>The GrapheneOS Trap</h3>

        <p>GrapheneOS appears to be the "most open" mobile option. It's based on AOSP, has better privacy than stock Android, and removes Google services by default. The conventional wisdom says everyone concerned about mobile freedom should use GrapheneOS.</p>

        <p>But here's the problem: <strong>GrapheneOS still requires Google Pixel hardware, and approximately 90% of users end up installing Google Play Services anyway</strong> because critical apps (banking, work, transportation) simply don't function without them.</p>

        <p>More importantly, if everyone in the free software community consolidated on GrapheneOS, what would happen?</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Android becomes the only "open" mobile standard.</strong> Developers target Android APIs exclusively.</li>
          <li><strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) become irrelevant.</strong> Why support web standards if everyone's on Android?</li>
          <li><strong>Future alternatives must be Android-compatible.</strong> New platforms can't compete without supporting Android apps.</li>
          <li><strong>Google wins forever.</strong> Even in the "free software" world, Google's APIs become the permanent standard.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Alternative Strategy: Promote Open Standards</h3>

        <p>A more strategic approach: <strong>use any phone (iPhone or Android), but reject native apps entirely in favor of Progressive Web Apps and open web standards.</strong></p>

        <p>When iPhone and Android compete, neither can control the standard. Developers who want to reach both platforms need platform-agnostic solutions. The web fills that gap. By using PWAs exclusively, you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep web standards relevant and maintained.</strong> Competition drives web API improvements.</li>
          <li><strong>Remain platform-agnostic.</strong> You're not locked into any vendor's ecosystem.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable future alternatives.</strong> When a truly free phone emerges, it just needs a good browser to run your apps.</li>
          <li><strong>Vote with your behavior.</strong> Every time you choose a PWA over a native app, you're promoting open standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is <em>more</em> strategically aligned with software freedom than using GrapheneOS, even though GrapheneOS is technically "more open." You're challenging the root problem (closed app ecosystems) rather than accepting a slightly better version of it.</p>

        <h2>Historical Precedent: Steve Jobs and Open Standards</h2>

        <h3>The Original iPhone: Web Apps First</h3>

        <p>Remarkably, this isn't a new insight. <strong>Steve Jobs originally envisioned the iPhone as a web app platform.</strong></p>

        <p>At WWDC 2007, before the App Store existed, Jobs announced that the iPhone would run third-party applications—but only as web apps. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1nwLilQy64" target="_blank">his presentation</a>, he said:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "The full Safari engine is inside of iPhone. And so, you can write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone. And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services. They can make a phone call, they can send an email, they can look up a location on Google Maps."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Jobs called this Apple's <strong>"sweet solution"</strong> for iPhone apps. The original iPhone shipped with no native app support—only web apps. Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2007/06/11iPhone-to-Support-Third-Party-Web-2-0-Applications/" target="_blank">official press release</a> stated that web apps could "extend iPhone's capabilities without compromising its reliability or security."</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <div class="callout-title">A Personal Note</div>
          <p>I was in the audience at WWDC 2007 when Steve Jobs made this announcement. At the time, many developers were skeptical—they wanted native apps with full hardware access. But looking back nearly two decades later, <strong>I still think Jobs was right.</strong></p>
          <p>If the iPhone had remained a web app platform, we wouldn't have the app ecosystem lock-in we have today. Developers would have built for open web standards, and users could switch between iPhone and Android (or any future platform) without losing their apps. The competitive pressure to support web standards would have kept the mobile web vibrant and innovative.</p>
          <p>Instead, we got two proprietary app ecosystems that now control mobile computing. Jobs' original vision was more strategically aligned with software freedom—even if it was less immediately profitable.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Of course, developer pressure eventually led to the App Store in 2008, and the rest is history. But Jobs' original vision was <strong>platform-agnostic web standards</strong>, not a proprietary app ecosystem.</p>

        <h3>Jobs on DRM: Another Open Standards Stance</h3>

        <p>Just months earlier, in February 2007, Jobs published <a href="https://macdailynews.com/2007/02/06/apple_ceo_steve_jobs_posts_rare_open_letter_thoughts_on_music/" target="_blank">"Thoughts on Music,"</a> a rare open letter criticizing Digital Rights Management (DRM). He wrote:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "The third alternative is to abolish DRMs entirely. Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM-free music encoded in open licensable formats. In such a world, any player can play music purchased from any store, and any store can sell music which is playable on all players. This is clearly the best alternative for consumers, and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Jobs argued that DRM was ineffective (since CDs were already DRM-free) and that open standards would benefit everyone. Within a year, iTunes began selling DRM-free music.</p>

        <p>These weren't just philosophical positions—they were <strong>strategic insights about how open standards enable platform competition and innovation.</strong></p>

        <h3>How Open Standards Helped Mac (and Linux)</h3>

        <p>Jobs understood this from experience. When Apple adopted <strong>Unix standards</strong> for Mac OS X in 2001, it transformed the Mac's viability:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Developers could port Unix software easily.</strong> The Mac gained access to decades of Unix tools and applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-platform development became simpler.</strong> Code written for Linux or BSD often worked on Mac with minimal changes.</li>
          <li><strong>The Mac became credible for technical users.</strong> Unix compatibility made it viable for developers and scientists.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But here's the counterintuitive part: <strong>Mac's adoption of Unix standards also helped Linux.</strong></p>

        <p>When Mac became Unix-compatible, it validated Unix as a modern desktop platform. Developers built cross-platform tools that worked on Mac, Linux, and BSD. The existence of a commercial Unix desktop (Mac) kept Unix standards relevant and maintained, which benefited the entire ecosystem.</p>

        <p>This competitive pressure eventually led Microsoft to create <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</strong>—Microsoft couldn't ignore that developers were choosing Mac and Linux because of Unix compatibility. WSL brought Linux directly into Windows, further accelerating Linux adoption everywhere.</p>

        <p><strong>Competition between Mac, Linux, and Windows around Unix standards made Unix ubiquitous.</strong> If everyone had consolidated on one platform, those standards might have stagnated.</p>

        <h3>The Pattern Repeats</h3>

        <p>The same dynamic played out with web standards:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Safari, Firefox, and Chrome competed</strong> on web standards compliance</li>
          <li><strong>No single browser could control the web</strong> (after IE's dominance ended)</li>
          <li><strong>Web standards improved rapidly</strong> because of competitive pressure</li>
          <li><strong>This enabled the modern web</strong> that works across all platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Jobs' original vision for iPhone web apps would have fit perfectly into this ecosystem. The App Store's success came at the cost of platform lock-in—exactly what web standards were designed to prevent.</p>

        <h2>Containers: Docker, OCI, and Podman</h2>

        <h3>How Docker's Dominance Led to Open Standards</h3>

        <p>The container ecosystem provides another perfect example of how competition creates open standards. When Docker launched in 2013, it revolutionized application deployment with a simple, elegant container runtime. By 2015, Docker had become so dominant that it risked creating a proprietary lock-in situation.</p>

        <p>But then something interesting happened: <strong>competition emerged, and Docker helped create an open standard to prevent fragmentation.</strong></p>

        <p>In June 2015, Docker, CoreOS, and other container industry leaders founded the <strong>Open Container Initiative (OCI)</strong> under the Linux Foundation. Docker donated its runtime (runc) and image format as the basis for open specifications. This wasn't altruism—it was strategic recognition that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple container runtimes were emerging</strong> (rkt from CoreOS, LXC, others)</li>
          <li><strong>Kubernetes was gaining traction</strong> and needed runtime-agnostic standards</li>
          <li><strong>Enterprise customers wanted portability</strong> across different implementations</li>
          <li><strong>A standards war would hurt everyone</strong> in the ecosystem</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What OCI Enabled</h3>

        <p>The OCI specifications (runtime, image, and distribution) created a level playing field:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Podman emerged as a Docker alternative.</strong> Red Hat developed Podman as a daemonless, rootless container engine that's fully OCI-compliant. You can run Docker containers with Podman without modification.</li>
          <li><strong>Kubernetes became runtime-agnostic.</strong> Any OCI-compliant runtime works with Kubernetes (containerd, CRI-O, etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>Container images became portable.</strong> Build with Docker, run with Podman, deploy to Kubernetes—all using the same OCI image format.</li>
          <li><strong>Innovation accelerated.</strong> New runtimes like gVisor and Kata Containers could compete on features while maintaining compatibility.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Counterintuitive Result</h3>

        <p>If everyone had consolidated on Docker as "the standard," we'd be locked into Docker's implementation. Instead, <strong>competition between Docker and alternatives like Podman maintains pressure to improve the OCI standard itself.</strong></p>

        <p>Today, many developers and organizations are switching to Podman for its security benefits (no daemon, rootless containers) while still using Docker images and Dockerfiles. This is only possible because of OCI standards.</p>

        <p>The pattern holds: <strong>competition between implementations (Docker, Podman, containerd) around an open standard (OCI) benefits everyone</strong> more than consolidation on a single "best" implementation would.</p>

        <h2>AI Agents: The Newest Example</h2>

        <h3>The MCP Revolution</h3>

        <p>The AI agent space is experiencing this dynamic right now. Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard for connecting AI applications to external systems. Think of it as "USB-C for AI agents."</p>

        <p>Here's what's fascinating: <strong>MCP exists because of competition between AI providers.</strong> If everyone consolidated on a single AI platform (say, OpenAI), that platform would use proprietary APIs for tool integration. There would be no need for an open standard.</p>

        <p>But because Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and others compete, developers need a platform-agnostic way to build tools and integrations. MCP fills that gap. Now we have open source AI agents like <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush" target="_blank">Crush by Charm Bracelet</a> that can use MCP to integrate with any tool or data source, regardless of which AI model powers the agent.</p>

        <h3>What This Enables</h3>

        <p>MCP's existence means:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Open source agents are viable.</strong> Projects like Crush don't need to build proprietary integrations for every tool.</li>
          <li><strong>Tool developers write once, support everywhere.</strong> An MCP server works with any MCP-compatible agent.</li>
          <li><strong>No single AI vendor controls the ecosystem.</strong> You can switch between Claude, GPT, or local models without losing your tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Future AI platforms can compete immediately.</strong> New entrants just need to support MCP to access the entire ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the AI community had consolidated on "the most open option" (perhaps a single open source model), we likely wouldn't have MCP. The competitive pressure between proprietary AI providers created the need for an open standard, which now benefits everyone—including open source projects.</p>

        <h2>The General Principle</h2>

        <div class="callout">
          <div class="callout-title">Competition → Cross-Platform Needs → Open Standards</div>
          <p>When proprietary platforms compete, they cannot all use each other's proprietary APIs. This creates demand for open, cross-platform standards. These standards enable future alternatives and prevent any single vendor from achieving permanent control.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>When Consolidation Kills Standards</h3>

        <p>Consolidating on "the most open option" can actually harm open standards when:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>It reduces competitive pressure.</strong> One dominant platform means no need for cross-platform standards.</li>
          <li><strong>It entrenches one vendor's APIs.</strong> Even if more "open," those APIs become the de facto standard.</li>
          <li><strong>It makes alternatives impossible.</strong> Future platforms must be compatible with the dominant platform's APIs.</li>
          <li><strong>It reduces diversity.</strong> Monocultures are fragile; diversity enables resilience and innovation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>When Competition Promotes Standards</h3>

        <p>Competition between proprietary platforms promotes open standards when:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>No single vendor can control the standard.</strong> Multiple platforms need neutral ground.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-platform development becomes valuable.</strong> Developers want to reach all platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Open standards fill the gap.</strong> They become the bridge between competing platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Future alternatives remain possible.</strong> New platforms can use the same open standards.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Strategic Framework for Technology Choices</h2>

        <h3>When Open Solutions Exist: Use Them</h3>

        <p>For <strong>desktop, laptop, and server computing</strong>, truly open solutions exist and work well:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> System76, Framework, Purism, or used ThinkPads with coreboot</li>
          <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> GNU/Linux distributions (Debian, Fedora, Arch, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Vast ecosystem of free software</li>
          <li><strong>Standards:</strong> Open formats, open protocols, open languages</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use 100% free software. There's no excuse not to.</p>

        <h3>When Open Solutions Don't Exist: Maintain Competition and Open Standards</h3>

        <p>For <strong>gaming</strong>, where no truly open console exists:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Don't consolidate on Steam Deck.</strong> This would kill open graphics APIs.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Linux gaming (Bazzite, etc.) where it works well.</strong> Support open platforms when viable.</li>
          <li><strong>Use PlayStation or other consoles where Linux doesn't work.</strong> Maintain competitive pressure.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> Competition keeps Vulkan/OpenGL relevant, enabling future Linux gaming improvements.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For <strong>mobile</strong>, where no truly open phone exists:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Don't consolidate on GrapheneOS.</strong> This would kill open web standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Use any phone (iPhone, Android, whatever).</strong> The OS doesn't matter strategically.</li>
          <li><strong>Reject native apps entirely; use PWAs only.</strong> Promote open web standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> Competition keeps web standards relevant, enabling future free phones.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For <strong>AI agents</strong>, where the landscape is rapidly evolving:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Support open standards like MCP.</strong> Use agents that support MCP regardless of underlying model.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't consolidate on one AI provider.</strong> Competition drives open standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Use open source agents when possible.</strong> Projects like Crush benefit from MCP's existence.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> No single AI vendor controls the ecosystem; alternatives remain possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Asymmetry Principle</h2>

        <p>This framework aligns with Richard Stallman's "asymmetry principle" from the GNU philosophy: <strong>encourage movement toward open standards, not toward closed ecosystems.</strong></p>

            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Consolidate on Steam Deck</td>
              <td>Toward DirectX (via Proton)</td>
              <td>DirectX becomes permanent standard</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Use Linux + PlayStation</td>
              <td>Toward Vulkan/OpenGL</td>
              <td>Enables future Linux gaming</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Consolidate on one AI provider</td>
              <td>Toward proprietary APIs</td>
              <td>One vendor controls ecosystem</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Support MCP across providers</td>
              <td>Toward open standards</td>
              <td>Enables open source agents</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Tactical vs. Strategic Thinking</h2>

        <p>The key insight is distinguishing between <strong>tactical improvements</strong> and <strong>strategic direction</strong>:</p>

        <p><strong>GrapheneOS</strong> is a tactical improvement (better privacy than stock Android) but a strategic failure (entrenches Android ecosystem).</p>

        <p><strong>Using PWAs on iPhone</strong> is a tactical compromise (proprietary OS) but a strategic success (promotes open web standards).</p>

        <p><strong>Steam Deck</strong> is a tactical improvement (Linux-based gaming) but a strategic risk (could entrench DirectX via Proton).</p>

        <p><strong>Using PlayStation alongside Linux gaming</strong> is a tactical compromise (proprietary console) but a strategic success (maintains open graphics APIs).</p>

        <p>When open solutions don't exist, <strong>strategic direction matters more than tactical purity.</strong> Your choices today determine what's possible tomorrow.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Think Like a Strategist</h2>

        <p>The free software movement needs more strategic thinking and less tactical purity. When truly open solutions exist, use them without compromise. But when they don't exist yet, focus on maintaining the conditions that will enable them to emerge in the future.</p>

        <p>This means:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Promoting open standards</strong> over "more open" platforms</li>
          <li><strong>Maintaining competitive pressure</strong> between proprietary platforms</li>
          <li><strong>Preventing consolidation</strong> that would entrench any single vendor's APIs</li>
          <li><strong>Thinking long-term</strong> about network effects and ecosystem dynamics</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Competition between proprietary platforms isn't ideal, but it's often better than consolidation around a "more open" platform that would kill the open standards we need for true alternatives to emerge.</p>

        <p><strong>Your behavior today shapes what's possible tomorrow.</strong> Choose strategically.</p>
